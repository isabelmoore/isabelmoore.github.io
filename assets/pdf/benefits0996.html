The <A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/alumni">UWAA's home page</A> is offering
a number of new features, including an on-line directory, address correction
forms and new information pages.<p>
Lost an old college friend? The UWAA is now your link to other alumni via its
new on-line, <A HREF="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~dev/alummail.html">alumni
e-mail directory</A>, which is accessed through the home page. This feature
includes a self-registry, so you control whether your e-mail address is listed
or not. The directory also lists addresses for personal home pages of alumni.<p>
In addition, alumni can also use the home page to check out their address
information on the alumni database. If it is not correct, you can update your
information and submit the updates via e-mail. This will ensure that
<i>you</i>, not your parents or former housemates, will receive <i>Columns</i>
magazine and other UWAA mailings.<p>
The UWAA home page has comprehensive information on membership and events. Now
there is also a complete clubs section that includes each club's board members
and upcoming events. <p>
<IMG SRC="national_car.gif" align=left vspace=4 hspace=10 width="143" height="62">Even if you are not
part of the information highway, you can take advantage of UWAA membership
benefits on the road. If you're planning an out-of-town trip that requires
renting a car, the UWAA has an agreement with <A
HREF="http://www.nationalcar.com/index.html">National Car Rental</A> giving
members a discount. There are special rates for daily, weekend, weekly and
monthly rentals, both in the U.S. and worldwide. For more information and to
get the special UWAA I.D. number and discount card, call the UWAA at (206)
543-0540 and ask for the membership department. <p>
Discounts are always part of UWAA membership benefits. If you're planning to
attend an away Husky football game, you'll get in free to the Washington Warm
Up pre-game event if you have your membership card.  For more information about
member benefits, call the UWAA at (206) 543-0540 in Seattle, or
1-800-AUW-ALUM.<p>
